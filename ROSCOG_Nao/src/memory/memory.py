Short-term memory:

Baddeley's model of working memory ?

-------------------------
Long-term memory:

    Procedural memory is memory for the performance of particular types of action. It is often activated on a subconscious level, or at most requires a minimal amount of conscious effort. Procedural memory includes stimulus-response-type information, which is activated through association with particular tasks, routines, etc. Roles defined as action sequences.

    Semantic memory is the encyclopedic knowledge that a person possesses. Knowledge like what the Eiffel Tower looks like, or the name of a friend from sixth grade, represent semantic memory. Access of semantic memory ranges from slightly to extremely effortful, depending on a number of variables including but not limited to recency of encoding of the information, number of associations it has to other information, frequency of access, and levels of meaning (how deeply it was processed when it was encoded).

    Episodic memory is the memory of autobiographical events that can be explicitly stated. It contains all memories that are temporal in nature, such as when one last brushed one's teeth or where one was when one heard about a major news event. Episodic memory typically requires the deepest level of conscious thought, as it often pulls together semantic memory and temporal information to formulate the entire memory.

In information science, an ontology can be defined as a "specification of a conceptualization" or a "body of formally represented knowledge [...] based on a conceptualization" (Gruber 1992).

acquire knowledge in
specified domains, store knowledge in defined structure and
organize knowledge in desired format for access, retrieval, trans-
fer, utilization and extension

To implement an ontology (create a knowledge base):

    A knowledge model (how do we represent objects and their relationships?)

    A persistence model (how do we store objects and their relationships?)

    A querying model (how do we access objects and their relationships?)
